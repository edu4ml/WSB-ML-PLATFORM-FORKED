# MVP 

Based on the domains and user stories we've discussed, here are some features that I think the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) should have:

1. **Course Domain**
   - Ability to create, edit, and delete courses and course components.
   - Ability to enroll in a course and track progress through course components.
   - Basic exercise and evaluation types (e.g. file upload, multiple choice).
   - Basic course progress tracking and reporting.

2. **User Domain**
   - User registration and authentication.
   - Basic user profile management.
   - User roles and permissions management.

3. **Resource Domain**
   - Ability to add new external resources and categorize them.
   - Ability to search for resources by category and tag.

4. **Evaluation Domain**
   - Basic evaluation criteria definition and submission.

5. **Notification Domain**
   - Basic system-wide notifications.

6. **Reporting Domain**
   - Basic course progress reports.

7. **Payment Domain**
   - Basic payment processing and validation.

8. **Content Domain**
   - Ability to create and edit course content.
   - Basic course content organization.

9. **Analytics Domain**
   - Basic data collection and storage.
   - Basic data analysis and visualization.

10. **Localization Domain**
   - Basic language selection and preference management.
   - Basic translation management and integration.

In summary, the MVP should focus on providing the essential features for creating and managing courses, user accounts, external resources, evaluations, and payments. It should also provide basic reporting and analytics capabilities and support for localization. Once the MVP is in place, additional features can be added based on user feedback and data insights.

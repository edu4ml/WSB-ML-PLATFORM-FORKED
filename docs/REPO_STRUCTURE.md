# Project Documentation

This document describes the structure and technical aspects of the Django project that serves static React bundles.

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project's directory structure:

- `frontend`: React frontend application source code.
- `infra`: Infrastructure-related files and configurations.
- `keys`: Directory containing cryptographic keys and related files.
- `node_modules`: Node.js dependencies for the frontend application.
- `server`: Server-side implementation and configurations.
- `shared`: Shared resources and utilities used by different parts of the application.
- `staticfiles-cdn`: Static files for the React frontend, served by the Django application.
- `templates`: Django templates directory.

## Configuration Files

- `webpack-stats.json`: Webpack-generated statistics for the frontend build.
- `webpack.config.js`: Webpack configuration file for the frontend.

## Technical Aspects

The project is a Django web application that serves static React bundles. The backend is implemented using Django, and the frontend is a React application.

The frontend is built using Webpack and Babel, and the dependencies are managed with npm. The static files generated by the frontend build process are served by the Django application from the `staticfiles-cdn` directory.

The project uses Gunicorn as the WSGI server for the Django application, and the configuration can be found in `gunicorn.conf.py`.

For testing, the project uses pytest, and the tests can be run using the `makefile` or the `manage.py` script.

Mutation testing is performed using Cosmic Ray, with the configuration specified in `cosmic-ray.conf`.
